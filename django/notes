Great extension to install for react: ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL etc. 
useful for creating react components:
      type "rce" and click tab to autocreate a components

Given that we have "--watch" in the script, we only need to run npm build dev once i think, maybee not at all


Would love to build personal CSS "library" of reusable components
